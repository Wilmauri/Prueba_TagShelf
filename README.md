# Prueba_TagShelf
This is the technical assessment test for the company TagShelf.

## TypeScript Configuration
Even though the problems in this assessment are quite complex, I decided not to use a `tsconfig.json` file. I wanted to keep things simple and focus on solving the tasks without additional configuration, as the default TypeScript settings were enough for this purpose.
